//java has access modifiers not specifiers
//final,abstract,public,private,protected
//private and protected cant be used with class.but private can be used if having inner class
//we can mention public in name or not.only diff is just writing class name it will be called as default class.
//by default , default is the access
//to access a class outside the package make sure it is public.default classes can be accessed in package only.
//same thing applies to vars as well
//private-specific class,default-specific package,public-any class or package,protected - subsiding class
//protected can be used in same package and other package if it is the parent of that.
